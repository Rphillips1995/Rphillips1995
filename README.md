- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Rphillips1995. I'm a 5th year PhD student at University of Alabama at Birmingham working with Dr. Jeremy Day. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in using -omics techniques to understand activity-dependent genome regulation in the brain. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on using single nucleus RNA-seq and ATAC-seq to understand how drugs of abuse affect both the transcriptome and epigenome of individual cell types within the Nucleus accumbens.
