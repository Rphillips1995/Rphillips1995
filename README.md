- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Rphillips1995. I'm a Postdoctoral fellow at the Lieber Institute for Brain Development working with Dr. Keri Martinowich. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in using -omics techniques to understand activity-dependent genome regulation in the brain. 
- ðŸŒ± On the computational side of my research, I am currently using single nucleus transcriptomics to both characterize cell type heterogeneity within the human brain and elucidate molecular signatures associated with psychiatric diseases.
